# Imaginary Numbers

An imaginary number is a mathematical quantity typically denoted by `i`. It is defined by:

```latex
i^2 = -1
```

### Etymology

The name “imaginary” was used in the 17th century to represent that these numbers were fictitious or not useful. This is because the definition of an imaginary number seems to contradict the behavior of real numbers.

### Contradiction

The definition of an imaginary number seems contradictory. This is because using the “standard” rules of multiplication, it is impossible to multiply a number by itself and get a negative value.

```latex
-a^2 = (-1)(a) * (-1)(a) = (-1)^2(a^2) = (1)(a^2) = a^2
```

### Motivation

Finding solutions to polynomial equations is one of the oldest problems in the history of mathematics, dating back thousands of years.

As you may already know, not all polynomials have real solutions. Sometimes, their solutions required taking the square root of -1, which was derided as a nonsensical result by mathematicians for hundreds of years.

It wasn’t until around 1600 (I made that up) that 

For a long time, these polynomials were ignored, or their roots were considered
