# Set

A set is a collection of distinct objects.

## Definition

A set is a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion). A
primitive notion is something that doesn't have a strict definition. It is an informal
idea that we understand from our everyday experience.

We are familiar with the notion of a collections of items. For instance, the alphabet is a collection of
letters, and the even numbers are a collection of numbers. Both of these are examples
of sets.

The objects within sets can be anything: coins, numbers, people, other sets, and so on.

## When are sets useful?

Many useful mathematical objects are built off of sets, including fields, groups, and vector spaces.
