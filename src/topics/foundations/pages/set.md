# Set

A set is a collection of distinct objects.

## Definition

A set is a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion). A
primitive notion is something that doesn't have a strict definition. It is an informal
idea that we understand from our everyday experience.

We are familiar with the notion of a collections of items. For instance, the alphabet is a collection of
letters, and the even numbers are a collection of numbers. Both of these are examples
of sets.

The objects within sets can be anything: coins, numbers, people, other sets, and so on.

## Naïve set theory

Naive set theory allows one to work with sets in an informal way, using natural language.

### The usefulness of naïve set theory

The word "naïve" has negative connotations associated with it, which may lead one to believe that
naïve set theory is no longer relevant. On the contrary, naïve set theory is still useful, and
suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.

### Problems with naive set theory

Naïve set theory allows for several paradoxes. Mathematicians were not happy about this, so they sought
to find a way to resolve the paradoxes while keeping all of other nice features of set theory. To do this,
they introduced axioms to set theory in an attempt to created an axiomatic set theory.

## Axiomatic set theory

Axiomatic set theory is an attempt to specify axioms for set theory to resolve the paradoxes that
are present in naïve set theory. Although there are many ways to axiomatize set theory, the most
popular version today is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, often abbreviated as ZFC. The "C" stands
for "choice" (the significance of this word is explained below).

At this time, I do not have the knowledge to fully understand ZFC. One set ZFC axioms can be
found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#Axioms).

## History

[Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) invented set theory. The first
article introducing set theory is called
["On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor%27s_first_set_theory_article),
published in 1874. It was further developed by [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) in his book
[Begriffsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift), published a few years later in 1879.

Around twenty years later, in 1900, the paradoxes of naïve set became more evident with examples from
Bertrand Russell and Ernst Zermelo, which motivated the creation of axiomatic set theory.

By 1908, Zermelo had a set of axioms for set theory, but in 1921, Abraham Fraenkel pointed out in
a letter that Zermelo's axioms did not account for some sets that many mathematicians believed to
exist at the time.

A year later, in 1922, Fraenkel modified Zermelo's axioms yields a theory denoted ZF. Adding
the axiom of choice, or an equivalent axiom, yields ZFC. 

## When are sets useful?

Many useful mathematical objects are built off of sets, including fields, groups, and vector spaces.
