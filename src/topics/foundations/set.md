# Set

A set is a collection of distinct objects.

### Definition of a set

There are two useful definitions of a set to be aware of. The first is an information
definition using natural language.

The other is axiomatic set theory. Applying axioms to sets is necessary to resolve
some of the paradoxes with naive set theory, which were considered to be a problem.

### Axiomatic set theory

ZFC.

### History

Georg Cantor invented set theory. He mostly worked with naive set theory, and produced
some very interesting conclusions. If you are getting started with set theory, it is
okay to start with the naive definition.

### When are sets useful?

Many useful mathematical objects are built off of sets.
