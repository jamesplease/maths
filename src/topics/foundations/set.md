# Set

A set is a collection of distinct objects.

## Definition

A set is a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion). A
primitive notion is something that doesn't have a strict definition. It is an informal
idea that we understand from our everyday experience.

We are familiar with the notion of a collections of items. For instance, the alphabet is a collection of
letters, and the even numbers are a collection of numbers. Both of these are examples
of sets.

The objects within sets can be anything: coins, numbers, people, other sets, and so on.

## Naïve set theory

Naive set theory allows one to work with sets in an informal way, using natural language. It was
the original version of set theory

### The usefulness of naïve set theory

The word "naïve" has negative connotations associated with it, which may lead one to believe that
naïve set theory has no relevance today. In reality, naïve set theory is still useful, even to
this day. It is a convenient system.

### Problems with naive set theory

Naïve set theory allows for several paradoxes. Mathematicians were not happy with this fact, so they sought
to find a way to resolve the paradoxes while keeping all of other nice features of set theory.

This effort can be described as creating an axiomatic set theory.

There are many different approaches to this. The most widely-used 

## Axiomatic set theory

Axiomatic set theory is an attempt to specify axioms for set theory to resolve the paradoxes that
are present in naïve set theory.

The most popular version today is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, often abbreviated as ZFC. The "C"
stands for "choice" (the significance of this word is explained below).

## History

[Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) invented set theory. The first
article introducing set theory is called
["On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor%27s_first_set_theory_article),
and it was

He mostly
worked with naïve set theory, and produced some very interesting conclusions. If you are
getting started with set theory, it is okay to start with the naive definition.

## When are sets useful?

Many useful mathematical objects are built off of sets.
